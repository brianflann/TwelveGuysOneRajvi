  <p>Conceived out of fire and brimstone, a league that would go on to alter the trajectory of mankind was born...</p>

  to deliver unrivalved drama to its members and their families that HBO executives could simply only dream of.</p>
  <p>As most of the league's members are part-time degenerate sports bettors, the victor's
